Feature: FieldHandlers
  In order to prove field handling is working properly
  As a developer
  I need to use the step definitions of this context

  # @d7 and @d8 scenarios assume a "standard" install of Drupal and require the
  # feature "fixtures/drupalN/modules/behat_test" to enabled on the site.

  Scenario: Test various node field handlers in Drupal 7 and 8
    Given "page" content:
      | title      |
      | Page one   |
      | Page two   |
      | Page three |
    When I am viewing a "post" content:

  # This is identical to the previous test, but uses human readable names for
  # the field names. This is better from a BDD standpoint. Please have a look at
  # FeatureContext::transformPostContentTable() to see how the mapping between
  # the machine names and human readable names is defined.
